<p>I am a senior at the <em>University of Vermont</em> majoring in <strong>mathematics</strong> and <strong>statistics</strong> and minoring in <strong>computer science.</strong> I have an intense interest in the utilization of the incredible power that modern data can afford us to help better the world.</p>
<p>I don't think that one should need a degree in a STEM field to be able to benefit from this data. Due to this one of my main interests visualizing data to accurately reflect the underlying trends without all of the fluff that data scientists love to layer on to make things look more complicated than they are.</p>
<p>When I am not in "school mode" I love to bike places and appreciate architecture whilst doing so.</p>
<p>Have a fantastic day!</p>
